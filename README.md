# My Mini Dragon is open source, pull requests are welcome :)
 
This is a personal demo project 2D game written in C++ using SDL 2.0 written at the time for the company I was working for!   
Started on October 2015.

In this game you have to navigate our mini dragon past the obstacles.
You do this by pressing up or down keys, which can be redefined.
Each time you press the keys, the dragon flies up or down.
Avoid the obstacles and the other dragons that may appear opposite of you.
